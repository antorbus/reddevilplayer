For minimal GUI elements: first zen mode MUST be deactivated. This is done on purpose to add friction to going out of zen mode. 
This is also why the player is a daemon.


fix this
 RAYLIB_MODULE_AUDIO=FALSE \
	  RAYLIB_MODULE_MODELS=FALSE \
	  RAYLIB_MODULE_RAYGUI=TRUE\
	  RAYLIB_CONFIG_FLAGS="-DSUPPORT_MODULE_RAUDIO=0 -DSUPPORT_MODULE_RMODELS=0"
