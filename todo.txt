For minimal GUI elements: first zen mode MUST be deactivated. This is done on purpose to add friction to going out of zen mode. 
This is also why the player is a daemon.


fix this
compile SDL without audio

TODO: 
 - fix next starts palying song?? is this good or bad? (think)
 - make player start playing right after open
 - addm "emac-like" compilation so that you can compile without gui + plugins 
 - fix key log thread crashing after lldb
 - add thread on syslog message
 - add to docs that the player is a vim-like music player for programming which allows for concentration and has no distractions
 - zen mode on by default
 - mood player (slow+ reverb / nightcore)
 - change 'sound' to 'track'
 - look at ReplayGain
 - equalizer?
 - open dir command sometimes freezes (gui  master)
 - fix fastforward effect -->solve with approx ma_dr_mp3_bind_seek_table
 - make finding audio files by type better
 - add audio UI instead of GUI?
 - buffer commads instead of losing them if processing is happening for gui
 - port as much code to multiplatform
 - mention vim-like in docs
 - add sleep to daemon for battery saving 
 - execution states set by the audio thread NOT by the command make this by command
 - clear error handling in metal_handlers
 - add error checks around pthread_mutex_lock because they can return error codes
 - switch to launchd
 - icon 
 - make it so that users cannot open help more than once
 - make text for help better
 - add queue files that can be created "playlists"
 - make open recursive
 - multiple queue things buttons to add songs to queue
 - better status bar logo
 - show song name + playtime + random + algorithmic + liked
 - support for SID etc (for this do data_callback on miniaudio with a plugin to libsidplayfp, will also work for other formats)
 - maybe start playback from prev song
